Processing.js and CCS file

- 2/19/20 uploaded files to run the GUI
1. To run the Processing.pde file, it would ask to create its own folder. 
2. Place the files in following path:
	receive_Stat.java and SEQUENCE_INDICATOR.java -> same directory with the Processing.pde
3. All the .mov, .mp3, .png files:
	create a folder "data" inside the directory created from step 1, and put the medi files in there.
